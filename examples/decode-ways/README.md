## Decode ways

The numDecodings algorithm solves the problem of decoding a given string s containing digits 1-9 into possible letter combinations. It uses dynamic programming to compute the number of valid decodings at each position, along with storing the combinations for each position, and returns the total number of valid decodings and their corresponding combinations.
