## Jump Game

The jumpPossibility algorithm determines whether it is possible to jump to the last index of the given nums array. It iterates through the array, keeping track of the maximum reachable index. If the maximum reachable index is greater than or equal to the last index, it returns true, indicating that a jump to the end is possible.

If it encounters a position where the maximum reachable index is less than the current index and the value at that position is zero, it means it cannot make any further progress and returns false, indicating that a jump to the end is not possible.
